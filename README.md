ETH-PR Analysis

Methodology:
The Ethereum blockchain operates using a transaction fee system and has utilized two consensus mechanisms throughout its history (Proof of Work and Proof of Stake). In order to conduct a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain users must purchase ETH to pay fees. These transactions are what gives Ethereum a use case and thus what gives ETH inherent economic value. The amount of fee required to complete a transaction is known as gas. Multiplying the daily total amount of gas used in transactions by the average daily gas price gives a daily total fee revenue for the Ethereum blockchain in terms of ETH. If this value is then multiplied by the daily average price of ETH in US dollars (USD), this will produce a daily total fee revenue for the Ethereum blockchain in terms of USD. The daily average ETH revenue in USD can be annualized by multiplying by 365. These values will be used as the revenue portion of the ratio. In order to calculate the price component of the ratio, the daily ETH market cap value can be generated. This value can be found by multiplying the daily average ETH price by the daily total ETH supply on that day. In order to calculate the daily PR ratio for ETH, one can simply divide the daily market cap of the ETH token by daily annualized revenue values from ETH transaction fees. This process was conducted using a self-produced MATLAB program.
